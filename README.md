# TabNukerNuker

Sublime text is an incredibly popular text editor. The first thing I noticed when I started using it,
was that it's a basket full of hacks.

Spaces for indentation is the single most popular indentation method across all languages (With the
notable exception of go) and in sublime text it's implemented as one of the dirtiest hacks of all time.

As a result, any attempt to use a real tab will be thwarted.

* The default "Insert tab" command inserts spaces
* Using sublime TextCommands to duplicate text with tabs in them will change them into spaces
* Anything you paste in containing tabs will be changed to spaces
* *Anything you paste in containing tabs will be changed to spaces*
* **Sublime text's indentation settings will mangle your pastes**
* **This is perfectl͝y̡ n̵orma̶l̵ ̢f̷o҉r a text̶ ̡e̢di͘͡͡t͏̵o̕r ͘͟a̸͟n̸̨d̸̶ s̷͡ho̶ul̨͞d͢ ͝n̡o̸t҉̢͢ ́͘b͎̤̆̓̽ͧȇ̠͙͖̼̻͉̫̦̱ͣ̉͐̅̔͗̉̀͜ ̡̫̝̹̳̲͎̊́͌q̶͓̤͚̻̤̩͎̈̄͊̒̽̕͡ṷ̖̟̦̻̟̜͍͇̓̽ͤ̋̔̐͜ê̓ͪ̆ͭͥ͏̶̫̱̺s̲̱̦̱͉͙̫̐͋ͨͤ̅͐ͩ͜͢t̨̛̰͙͇̲̮̤͒̂i̢̠͐̐͆̿ͫ͟͞o̱̘̻͓̼͍ͤͦ͘n͂͌͟͏̮͎̘̲̜ĕ̹̝̳̪͎͇̱ͦ͊ͧ̂d̨͋͒ͨ̃ͮ̀҉̠̪̤̫͈̱̝͙̞**

This is unacceptable for a text editor, and this plugin fixes it without breaking spaces for indentation
